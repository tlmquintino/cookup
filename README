cookup 0.1

DESCRIPTION

Easy build from source and install tool for UNIX platforms (using perl)

RATIONALE

Cookup was inspired in homebrew for MacOSX, although does not aim to be as complete.
I wanted a tool with minimal requirements (C/C++ compiler and Perl),
to build and install software on super computers and clusters that 
often do not have Ruby or Python.

The initial code for cookup was based on the install-deps.pl script from the
http://github.com/coolfluid/coolfluid3 project. This code was improved with
object oriented perl features.

In cookup each package is installed following a recipe (homebrew brews formulas),
which is a simple Perl class.

REQUIEREMENTS

* C/C++ compiler
* Perl 5
